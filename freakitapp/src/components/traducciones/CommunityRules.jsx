            <h1>Community Rules</h1>
            <p>
            At Freakit!, we strive to ensure that the entire otaku community feels safe, respected, comfortable, and in an environment conducive to the development of personal relationships. For this, in addition to the technological efforts we make at Freakit! to make the platform a safe place, we need the collaboration of all users to create a quality community. If you are a respectful, kind, educated person who wants to create healthy relationships within the application, you are welcome! On the other hand, if you enter this community solely to create toxicity, generate negativity, or attack other users, your account will be quickly deleted. If you infringe any of the terms and conditions of Freakit!, you will be automatically expelled from the community, your profile will be deleted, and you will not be able to create another one. Think before you act. At Freakit! we do not admit under any circumstances:

            <ul className="list-disc">
                <li><b>Nudity:</b> For someone to see your naked body or any part of it without being asked is sexual harassment. Do not think that putting a photo of some intimate part of your body on your profile will make it more attractive, on the contrary, it can be annoying, unpleasant, grotesque, and even insulting.</li>
                <li><b>Harassment:</b> Harassment is completely prohibited at Freakit!, no matter what type it is, sexual, verbal, psychological, racial, cyberbullying, any. The moment you harass any user of the community or the creators of the same, you will be immediately expelled.</li>
                <li><b>Violence:</b> You are not allowed to post photos on your profile that may be disturbing. Blood, fights, physical attacks, terrorist attacks, disasters, wars, etc., or any image, comment, or conversation that may affect the sensitivity of other users is completely prohibited. This would mean the immediate expulsion of your profile on Freakit!</li>
                <li><b>Incitement to hate:</b> Freakit! is a safe place for all users. Any type of hate incitement on your profile, conversations, or comments due to racial, sexual, gender, religious discrimination, physical appearance, or for any other reason will be sanctioned with immediate expulsion.</li>
                <li><b>Spam:</b> Freakit! is not an advertising platform. Do not spam other websites, applications, projects, etc. We do not think that other users would appreciate it, it can even be annoying and bothersome.</li>
                <li><b>False profiles:</b> If your profile is fake, for any reason such as not being who you say you are, you are underage but have modified your date of birth, lie about your life, are impersonating someone else, or simply nothing about you appears, you will be automatically deleted.</li>
                <li><b>Offering services:</b> Freakit! is not a job search or investor search platform. Of course, you can talk to your matches about your projects, but do not use this application solely to find financing or to offer your professional services (of any kind).</li>
                <li><b>Prostitution or human trafficking:</b> Freakit! is not a people market. Freakit! is not a human catalog. Freakit! PROHIBITS the use of the application to recruit people for the purpose of prostituting them or obtaining any benefit from them by exploiting their body or being. Not only will your profile be deleted if you engage in any of these acts, but you will also be immediately reported to the relevant legal authorities.</li>
                <li><b>Scams:</b> Want to earn some extra money with your super scam? Go elsewhere, Freakit! is not the place. Any attempt to scam any user of the community will be immediately sanctioned with expulsion.</li>
