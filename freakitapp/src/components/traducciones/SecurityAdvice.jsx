            <h1>Safety Tips</h1>
            <p>
                At Freakit, we want meeting new people to become something exciting, safe, and fun, but for that, you always have to be careful when you start interacting with people you do not know or are beginning to know. For this, we have created the following advice for your conversations with that person and with your dates, always using common sense and prioritizing your safety above all.
            </p>

                Online Safety
            </p>
            <p><ul className="list-disc">
                <li>Protect your personal information. You should never share data such as your social security number, your home or work address, or details about your daily habits with people you do not know. If you have children or any underage family members, limit the information about them in your profile and in the first conversations. Avoid information about these minors such as which school they go to, how old they are, or their name.</li>
                <li>Do not share financial information.</li>
                <li>Never send money, especially if it is through a bank transfer. Do not share information that could be used to access your financial accounts even if the person asking for the money says it's an emergency. In case someone asks you for money, report it with the report emoticon that appears in each profile or in each chat room, this icon will take you directly to our email (<a href="mailto:freakitapp@gmail.com" target="_blank">freakitapp@gmail.com</a>).</li>
                <li>Always be wary of long-distance relationships or those between different countries. Be aware of scammers, especially if they ask for financial help. Be suspicious of anyone who does not want to meet you in person or who simply does not want to make a video call, they may not be who they claim to be.</li>
            </ul></p>
            <p className="text-2xl font-bold">
                Meeting in Person
            </p>
            <p><ul className="list-disc">
                <li>Take your time to get to know the person you are talking to before meeting them physically. Never be afraid to ask the necessary questions to feel safe. A good tool is a phone call or better a video call.</li>
                <li>The first few times you meet, do it in a public place, crowded and where there are people. Never do it at your home, the other person's home, or any other secluded or private place. If the other person insists on going to a private or secluded place, end the date.</li>
                <li>Always notify a trusted friend or relative of where you will be, with whom, and what you are going to do. Make sure your mobile is charged and always with you.</li>
                <li>Be aware of your limits regarding drugs, such as alcohol or other substances. Such drugs can cloud your level of alertness in dangerous situations. If the other person pressures you to take any type of substance, the date ends at that moment. No one should pressure you to take drugs or drink alcohol if you do not feel like it or do not want to.</li>
                <li>Always keep an eye on your drink, where it comes from, how it has been served, and where the drink is at all times. Many of the substances that are introduced in drinks are for non-consensual sexual relations or to nullify your will. These substances are odorless, colorless, and tasteless.</li>
                <li>Keep all your personal and important things with you at all times.</li>
                <li>If you feel uncomfortable on the date, there is nothing wrong with leaving and ending the date earlier than expected. And if you see that something is not right in order to leave, ask for help from anyone you see as trustworthy, waiters, shop assistants or call a friend. If not, call the emergency number of your city.</li>
            </ul></p>

                LGBTQ+ Travel
            </p>
            <p><ul>
                <li>We understand the difficulties and dangers that being part of the community can entail in certain countries, which is why at Freakit we advise you to be cautious and inform yourself about the situation in each country before traveling.</li>
                <li>At <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://ilga.org/" target="_blank">ILGA World</a> you can learn about the different laws regarding sexual orientation in each country.</li>
            </ul></p>
            <p className="text-2xl font-bold">
                Sexual Health and Consent
            </p>
            <p><ul className="list-disc">
                <li>Always use protection during sexual intercourse, such as condoms. This can significantly reduce the transmission of diseases such as HIV and unwanted pregnancies.</li>
                <li>Take care of your health regularly. Many sexually transmitted diseases do not show symptoms, and some, like herpes, can be transmitted even without sexual intercourse.</li>
                <li>Communicating to the other person that you want both of you to get tested for sexually transmitted diseases is not a bad thing. Communication and your safety come first, and at Freakit! we want your sexual health to be the most important thing before having sexual relations.</li>
                <li>All intimate and/or sexual relationships must be previously approved by all parties involved in the relationship. Consent can be withdrawn at any time. You owe nothing to anyone.</li>
                <li>If you see someone feeling insecure or uncomfortable, or if they are unable to show appropriate consent due to the consumption of any substance or if they are in a mental state in which they cannot give their consent fully, you should not have intimate and/or sexual relations with that person. The communication of all parties must be fully affirmative.</li>
            </ul>
                Remember that even if you follow all these tips, there is no perfect way to avoid all risks. If you feel you are in danger, call law enforcement immediately and report it. For immediate assistance in case of an emergency, you can call 112 if you are in Spain, 911 in Mexico, 133 in Chile, and 123 in Colombia.
