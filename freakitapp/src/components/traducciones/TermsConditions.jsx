              Service Modification and Cancellation

              <p>
              If Freakit! decides to modify any of its functionalities or add others, you will be informed either by email or within the same application.
                <br />
                Similarly, if Freakit! is obligated to suspend the entirety of the Service, we are obliged to communicate this to you as soon as possible, either by email or within the application, whenever possible. If we are prevented from doing so due to security reasons or a failure in the application&apos;s operating system, we will not be able to notify you.
                <br />
                En cuanto a la suspensión por su parte del servicio, usted podrá
                hacerlo en el momento en el que deese.
                <br />
                Regarding the suspension of the service on your part, you may do so whenever you wish. You have the right and freedom to delete or stop using the application whenever you want.
                <br />
                However, your Freakit! account may be deactivated, deleted, or blocked by the Freakit! team if it is considered that you are breaching or infringing the community rules or the terms and conditions of use set out in this Agreement.

              <p className="text-2xl font-bold">User Safety</p>
              <p>
              Within the application, various functionalities are implemented to ensure that interaction and communication between users are respectful, consensual, and reliable, as Freakit! does not allow two users to communicate without the prior consent of each.
                <br />
                Freakit! includes a facial verification service for each user to confirm their identity. This will be reflected on the profile with a &quot;verified profile&quot; symbol. This verification is carried out in two steps: the user will send two photographs through the app, mimicking others previously displayed. These photographs will be validated by the team as long as they meet the following requirements: the user must have at least two photographs on their profile in which the user can be clearly recognized along with the images sent for verification. In these photos, the face must be visible, and filters that could distort the person&apos;s real appearance must not be used. Once the team verifies the identity, the photographs sent by the user for verification will be deleted immediately.
                <br />

              <p>
              Once the user has created their account on Freakit! and accepted the Terms and Conditions, the user grants Freakit! a worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, and royalty-free license to: host, store, use, copy, display, reproduce, adapt, edit, publish, modify, and distribute the information. This includes all posts made in the Service and all interactions with other users within the Service.
                <br />
                Thus, Freakit! has the right to use various conversations, interactions, posts, even screenshots where your content appears, meaning everything you do within the Service can be used by Freakit! in case of any litigation as evidence or accusations.
                <br />
                In turn, to prevent the use of your content outside the Service by third parties, you authorize Freakit! to act on your behalf against illegal uses of your content.
                <br />
                With this, you declare and confirm that all the data you publish in the Service are real and truthful.
                <br />

                In the event that you approach Freakit! with any suggestion or comment, you grant Freakit! the right to use that information for any purpose without any compensation to you.
                <br />
                Regarding advertising, you agree that both Freakit! and any external partners Freakit! collaborates with may publish or share advertising within the Service.
